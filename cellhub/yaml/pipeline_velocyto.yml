  memory: 2000M
  # number of threads to use for sorting
  threads: 24

# General options for velocyto

  # Passed to velocyto (same as used for cellranger count)
  # e.g. for human: /gfs/mirror/genomes/10x/refdata-cellranger-GRCh38-1.2.0
  # e.g. for mouse: /gfs/mirror/genomes/10x/refdata-cellranger-mm10-1.2.0
  cellranger_anno:
  # per CPU memory for velocyto in M | 'none' if only threads should be used
  memory: 10000M
  # number of threads to use for velocyto
