# To skip certain samples from being processed use a colon seperated list e.g.
#skipsamples: "Sample09;Sample10"

# If this sample requires demultiplexing, use a csv metadata_file  which includes a:
# project_name, library_id, pid and barcode_original column. If not then the barcode
# column can be ommitted. pid must not contain an underscore if demultiplexing.
project_name: "ox_va_pb_sf"

# This file must be a tab seperated file and contain the following columns: project_name, library_id, pid, barcode_library, barcode_original

# If necessary to distinguish between different libraries, you can add a prefix and/or suffix to the library_id
