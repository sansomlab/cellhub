# Pipeline pipeline_demultiplex.py configuration file
# ===================================================
#

# Path of reference fasta file, should be of the same species but does not necessarily need to be the exact cellranger reference. e.g. Human /gfs/mirror/genomes/10x/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A/fasta/genome.fa

# Parameters for souporcell 
# -------------------------------------------
# If running pipeline from within the container, please provide the path derived from either user-defined or system-defined bind paths in this section.
souporcell:
  # ###
  genotype-aware: true
  # Path of input tsv file, required for genotype-aware demultiplexing. For details of required columns please see the pipeline_souporcell.py documentation
  demultiplex_table: ./demultiplex.tsv
  
  # Path of the souporcell container. Required.
  container-dir: /gpfs3/well/sansom/users/rrl815/devel/souporcell-202311/souporcell_latest.sif
  # To read and write files on the host system from within the container, specify bind paths manually. The directories $HOME , /tmp , /proc , /sys , /dev, and $PWD are already among the system-defined bind paths. If the root directory is different in your cluster, please write your root directory here. 
  bind-path: /gpfs3
  
  # Number of clusters. Required. 
  cluster-number: 8
  # Max threads to use, more threads required if remapping process should be done
  threads: 10
