database:
    # database location and name
    url: sqlite:///./celldb.dir/csvdb


# Tables that will be loaded into the celldb
# ==========================================
#
# * Tables with per-cell information must contain the columns
#    "barcode" and "library_id"
#
# * Indexes are automatically created for: 
#   (sample_id), (library_id), (library_id, barcode_id)
#
# * Recognised table parameters (keys) are:
#   - name: the name of the table that will be created in the database
#   - path: the path to a directory containing a set of tables OR
#         to a single file containing a table
#   - glob: *if* path is a directory: a glob expression to be expanded to 
#          match the set of tables (optional)
#   - extra_indexes: Comma seperated list of extra indexes to be set
#          (optional)

table:

    # Sample table
    # ------------  
    # This is a required, user supplied table. It contains:
    #
    # (1) the mapping of sample_id to library_id
    # (2) sample metadata fields as appropriate such as
    #     condition, genotype, replicate etc
    # (3) the mapping of sample_ids to demultiplexing IDs
    #     as/if needed for multiplexed experiments.
