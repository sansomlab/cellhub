# General Cellranger configuration options
# ----------------------------------------

cellranger:

    # The minimum system requirements for cellranger
    # are 8 cores & 64 GB RAM
    #
    # Note that allocating additional memory substantially
    # shortens the wall time, see plots here:
    # https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/overview/system-requirements
    #
    # It is recommended to use 16 cores and 128GB RAM if possible
    #
    # ...but this needs to be traded off with being able to 
    # get the resources on the cluster & the number of samples
    # being processed. 
    #
    # Note: the martian runtime seems to use minimum
    # units of 4 cores for job processing, so specify cores
    # in units of 4.

    # Set the number of cores to use for each job
    localcores: 8
    # Set the amount of memory (in GB) to use for each job
    localmem: 64
    
    # Disable secondary analysis, e.g. clustering. Optional.
    # Default: false.
